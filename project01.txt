7. (Optional) Comments about the project:	
This was really fun. I used AI to give me a path to follow so I did not get confused or lost in the instructions. I was able to use the diagram I made earlier 
to find the pattern of the connections, and once I found the pattern, it was smooth sailing (with my random questions being answered by the Custom Gem Model).
